# esp32-car-remote

this is my second new README in a week so i'm going to keep this short.

- [DRV8833](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv8833.pdf)
- [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32)
- motors from old _"smart"_ vaccum
- WiFi
- battery
- rust client
- c++ firmware.

## usage
no lol

fine..`pio run -t upload && cd client && cargo run the_ip:3333` (you can `pio device monitor` with the ESP32 plugged in for the IP)

## y no commit history??

i may have had my wifi password commited for 7 months...
